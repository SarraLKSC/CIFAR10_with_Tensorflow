# CIFAR10_with_Tensorflow
CIFAR10 is an image dataset available on the keras API which mean we can easily load it directly from keras.datasets with the load_data() method that automatically splits data into trainset and test set.  The images are of size 32x32 and colored (RGB representation). The trainset and the testset contain 50000 and 10000 images respectively.
